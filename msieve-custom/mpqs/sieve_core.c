		  uint32 poly_start, uint32 num_poly) {

	/* The core of the sieving code. This routine performs
	   the sieving and relation collection for 'num_poly'
	   polynomials at a time.

	   Because this is the self-initializing quadratic sieve,
	   groups of polynomials are related. There are 'total_poly'
	   polynomials that share the same 'a' value; we number them
	   from 0 to total_poly-1. poly_start refers to the index
	   of the initial polynomial of the group of num_poly. 

	   Ordinarily, you initialize one polynomial, sieve with it,
	   initialize the next polynomial, sieve with it, etc. However,
	   we want the sieve interval to be small, and when it's very
	   small but the factor base is large we will spend a lot
	   of time initializing polynomials and only a little time 
	   sieving. Self-initialization improves that a lot, but when
	   the factor base exceeds the cache size, even for previous
	   versions of this program, polynomial initialization would
	   take 50% of the total sieving stage runtime when the sieve
	   interval is small. We could make the interval larger, but
	   that means smooth relations occur less often; sieve time
	   does not scale well but poly initialization time does.

	   This routine takes a novel approach: for small factor base
	   primes it sieves one polynomial at a time. However, for
	   all the other factor base primes (90+% of the factor base,
	   in a big factorization) it does not sieve at all, but fills
	   a hashtable with the locations of which prime updates which
	   sieve offset. There is a separate hashtable for each polynomial,
	   and a separate hashtable for positive and negative sieve
	   values. Because these hashtables do not interact with each other,
	   we can do all the sieving for a few factor base primes in one
	   polynomial, then switch to the next polynomial and do the 
	   sieving for the same primes. For these few primes all of the 
	   sieving for one poly happens at once, and so the roots of these 
	   primes can then be updated to become roots of the next polynomial.

	   The upshot is that we deal with a block of primes at a time,
	   and for that block do all the sieving for num_poly polynomials;
	   the roots for each prime get updated whenever sieving for a
	   polynomial has finished. This in effect performs a tiling of
	   the sieve interval, the factor base, and the auxiliary information
	   needed to switch polynomials. When the tile size of these three
	   quantities is chosen small enough, everything fits in cache
	   for the duration of the sieving.

	   Note that putting all the updates into a hashtable uses up
	   much more space than sieving with it; however, when filling up
	   a hashtable linearly only one cache line per hash bin is active
	   at any given time, and if the number of bins is small enough
	   the processor can fit all the updates into store buffers as
	   they happen.  Contrast that with filling up a conventional 
	   sieve interval, where all the cache lines in the interval
	   are active.

	   All of the hashtables are filled in first; then we proceed one
	   polynomial at a time. For each polynomial we sieve with the
	   small factor base primes, add in the sieve values from the 
	   appropriate set of hash bins (the bin size matches the sieve
	   block size for this implementation), then do trial factoring
	   on presumed smooth sieve values. There's one more perk to doing
	   things this way: since a hash bin can be made to contain the
	   actual primes as well as the log values of those primes, 
	   trial factoring can be sped up an order of magnitude by reusing
	   the hash bins to detect primes that divide sieve values.

	   In short: black magic, awful mess, really fast. */
