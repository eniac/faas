
Building MSIEVE without GMP and GMP-ECM
=======================================

These files build MSIEVE in a way that includes the GMP-ECM library. 
 
If you don't want to use GMP-ECM, you can build MSIEVE without using
this library in the following way:

1. Load the MSIEVE solution - msieve.sln - in the Visual Studio 
   2010 IDE.
2. Open the Property Manager and expand each of the four sub-projects
   in turn and perform the following operation.
3. Open each of the four project configurations in turn and remove
   the 'gmp_ecm_config' item (right click and select 'Remove').

4. The build will then complete without GMP and GMP-ECM support.

Blame Microsoft for the apparent lack of an easier way to do this.

Using GMP-ECM
=============

GMP-ECM relies on a multiple precision integer arithmetic library,
either GMP or MPIR, a windows freiendly fork of GMP.  The Msieve
Visual Studio build is now set up to use the MPIR library as the 
default as thi9s pprovides fast x64 assembler code support on 
Windows that GMP does not provide.  GMP can still be used by 
editing the VC++ gmp_ecm_config.vsprops sheet to set the user
macro to 'gmp' (without the quotes) instead of 'mpir'. 

The layout and naming of the directories holding MSIEVE, MPIR and 
GMP-ECM is assumed to be:

    common_root_directory 
        mpir
        gmp-ecm
        msieve
        
(although the name of the msieve directory doesn't matter). If the 
MPIR and GMP-ECM directories are named and/or located differently
it will then be necessary to rename these directories as above 
or modify the gmp_ecm_config.vsprops properties file so that it
uses the revised names.  The 'Additional Include Directories'
(under Properties|C/C++) and the 'Additional Dependencies' (under
Properties|Linker|Input) will need to be changed to match the
names and locations for MPIR and GMP-ECM.
